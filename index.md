# Hello World
I am a new developer working at an exciting startup called [Wallet.Services](https://wallet.services) doing blockchain stuff in Edinburgh!  We use C# and all the latest good stuff like .Net Core and Service Fabric.  In my spare time I like learning other progaming languages and when not coding I ride a bike and play the piano.
